            <h2>Probability Calculation</h2>
			<p>
         To calculate the probability of student having blue eyes, divide the number of students with blue eyes by the total number of students.
         Similarly, we can calculate the probability that student in his/her third year, and the probability of male student.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The probability that a student has blue eyes given he is a man can be calculated by dividing the number of male students with blue eyes by the number of male students.
			This is a conditional probability.
			
			The probability that a student has blue eyes given she is a woman can be calculated similarly.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Pearson correlation</h2>
			<p>
			Pearson correlation value between the age and the computer time: -0.04
			Age and computer time is weakly negatively correlated. Maybe senior students spend less time on computer entertainment.
			</p>
         <p>
         Pearson correlation value between the playgames and the watchtv: 0.26
         Hours spent on playgames and the watch tv are positively correlated, demonstrating that people who enjoy games also tend to enjoy watching tv.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Computer hours by gender</h2>
			<p>
			There is no significant evidence showing a difference in hours spent on computer between male and female students.
         </p>
         
         <p>Conducting a 2-sided t-test at .95 confidence level, the t-statistic is -1.78>-1.96 so we failed to reject the null hypothesis</p>
         <p>Conducting a 2-sided permutation test at .95 confidence level with 1000 repeated sampling, there are 41>25(This number is random!) more extreme difference between male and female mean. So we failed to reject null hypothesis.</p>
